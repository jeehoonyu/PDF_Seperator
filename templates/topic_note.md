## One-Sentence Summary

<!-- What is this concept, stated in one sentence an engineer would use in conversation? -->
<!-- Not a dictionary definition. A working description. -->

## Physical / Conceptual Intuition

<!-- WHY does this work? What is the underlying principle? -->
<!-- If it's an equation: what physical law produces this form? What does each term represent? -->
<!-- If it's a method: what problem does it solve, and why this approach instead of alternatives? -->
<!-- Use analogies if they genuinely help. Avoid analogies that obscure. -->

## Formal Statement

<!-- The precise mathematical or technical statement. -->
<!-- For equations: display equation, then define every variable with units immediately below. -->

$$
\text{[Equation here]}
$$

| Variable | Meaning | SI Unit |
|----------|---------|---------|
|          |         |         |

## Key Assumptions

<!-- Numbered list. Each assumption should state what is assumed AND what happens if violated. -->

1. **[Assumption]** — If violated: [consequence or what model to use instead]

## Derivation Sketch

<!-- Key logical steps only. Not a full derivation — just enough to see where the result comes from. -->
<!-- If derivation is long, summarize the strategy and reference source pages. -->

## Validity and Limitations

<!-- MOST IMPORTANT SECTION FOR ENGINEERING USE -->
<!-- When does this model/equation/method break down? -->
<!-- What does the failure look like (overpredicts? underpredicts? diverges? gives nonsense?) -->
<!-- What should be used instead in each failure case? -->

| Condition | Failure Mode | Use Instead |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|           |             | [[]]        |

## Worked Example

<!-- A concrete problem with full solution. -->
<!-- Show the reasoning process, not just algebra. -->
<!-- If from source: cite page. If constructed: note "[Constructed example]" -->

**Problem:**

**Solution:**

## Common Mistakes

<!-- Things practitioners actually get wrong. Not trivial errors. -->
<!-- Each should explain WHY the mistake is tempting and HOW to avoid it. -->

## Dimensional / Sanity Check

<!-- Verify the equation is dimensionally consistent. -->
<!-- Check limiting behavior: as [variable] → 0 or → ∞, does the result make physical sense? -->

## Related Topics

<!-- Wiki-links to connected concepts. Brief note on the relationship. -->
